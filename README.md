## Preparation
Below is some "prep work" you can do before the day of the online training. While these are not REQUIRED, going through them will give you a head start on the work of actually coding the server and client apps during class.

 * Download and read ["A Guide to REST and APIs"](http://transform.ca.com/REST-API-Design-Guide.html?source=ORMCourse) 
 * Read the online specs for the [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/) Hypermedia format
 * Read ["A Web API Design Methodology"](http://www.infoq.com/articles/web-api-design-methodology) and/or watch the [O'Reilly Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3153) (paywall)
 * Review the Slides for ["Implementing Hypermedia Clients: It's Not Rocket Science"](http://www.slideshare.net/rnewton/not-rocketscience-22155935) and/or watch the [O'Reilly FluentConf video](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/fluent-conference-2013/9781449371579/part46.html) (paywall)

## Reminders
 * Some background material and starter files will be shared through a *GitHub* [repo](https://github.com/apiacademy/oreilly-hypermedia-training) throughout the course. Having a github account will help you get the most out of the day. If you don't have access to Github, a ZIP file will be available via *DropBox* or *Email*

 * Throughout the day, portions of the instructor's code will be posted to *Heroku* for validation and testing.

 * Slides will be shared online and downloadable during the day.

 * All code examples will be in “plain Javascript”, and not depend on any libraries or frameworks. Build the assignments without relying on external libraries/frameworks, and use whatever helps you get the most out of the sessions.

 * You'll spend most of the day writing code. Have a comfortable place to work, and a computer loaded with your favorite developer tools.

 * There will be two scheduled 15 min breaks (90 minutes into AM and PM sessions) and a lunch break of 30 minutes. Additional break are up to attendees.
